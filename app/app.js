          Hey, woman
Hey, woman
Hey, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
What you need?
She give tenfold, come here, papa, plant your seed
She can grow it from her womb, a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see
You can reciprocate
I got delicious taste
You need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say </p>

          I can be your lady, I'm a woman
          I'm a mother****er but they got a problem
          Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
          Put that paper in the picture, like a diorama
          Gotta face a lot people that are opposite
          'Cause the world told me we ain't got that common sense
          Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
          And you will never know a God, without a Goddess
          As honest as ****in' honest get
          And I could be on everything
          I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
          I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
          I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
          And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
          Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
