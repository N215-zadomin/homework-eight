                Love got me ****ed up
                Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
                Had to give in, couldn't give up
                I just want you, but I don't do drugs
                Still I want you, ooh-ooh
                Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
                Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
                Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
                All I want is you, ooh-ooh
                Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
                Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
                Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
                Baby, I've been in my bag
                You don't really hit me back
                'Cause I feel like I'm attached
                Should've never kissed you back
                Ever since I fell in love
                Not quite like being trapped
                More like a sickness that
                Keeps me addicted bad

                Hard for me to let you go (let you go, let you go)
                My body wouldn't let me hide it (hide it)
                No matter what, I wouldn't fall (wouldn't fall, wouldn't fall)
                Fightin' through the thunder, lightning
                Forgive me, I brought it upon mysеlf
                (Ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh)
                Needed a fix of you, not just a kiss from you
                I needed more
                Lovе got me ****ed up
                Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
