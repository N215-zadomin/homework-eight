For this assignment we continued to practice JQuery. For this project, we had to create a navigation bar that has four links, and add content to the page when you click on a link. We were to only use one page and load all the content onto that page. Based on the instructions, all pages must have full content. This assignment was actually fairly simple and pretty fun to complete. I didn't find myself struggling all that much.
